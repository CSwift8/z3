# About

Z3 is a Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) language, used see if equations or formulas are satisfiable, or have a possible solution.

Z3 is most commonly found in software verification, constraint solving, geometrical problems, security, and other applications that benefit from quick mathematical computing.

Z3 was created by the Research in Software Engineering (RiSE) group at Microsoft Research and, as of 2015, has become an open-source language. The open-source Github repository for Z3 can be found at https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3.
